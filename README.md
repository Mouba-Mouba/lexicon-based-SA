# lexicon-based-SA

The performance of a customized lexicon-based sentiment analysis technique and the open-source VADER sentiment analysis tool are compared in this project. We built a custom lexicon using a dataset of 1,000 tweets and evaluated its performance against VADER's pre-trained lexicon. The accuracy of each technique's classification of tweets as neutral, negative, or positive was assessed. The results indicate that both techniques achieved 92.40% accuracy. This illustrates how custom lexicons that adapt to certain datasets can perform on the same level as popular tools like VADER.
