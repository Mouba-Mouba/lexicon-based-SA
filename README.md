# lexicon-based-SA

This project uses a dataset of 1,000 synthetic tweets to evaluate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis techniques based on lexicon and machine learning. The VADER lexicon-based tool
and a logistic regression model were used to examine the dataset, which was generated systematically with balanced sentiments. Although the results demonstrate that both approaches attain exceptional accuracy on the dataset, each has distinct benefits. This analysis offers insights into possible advancements for sentiment analysis approaches and emphasizes the significance of choosing the best technique based on requirements.
